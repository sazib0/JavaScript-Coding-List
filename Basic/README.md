cd Basic

# Run any program
node 01-arithmetic-operations.js
node 02-string-manipulation.js
node 03-array-operations.js
node 04-conditional-logic.js
node 05-loops-patterns.js
node 06-function-examples.js
```

## üìö Learning Objectives

After completing these programs, you will understand:

1. **Basic Syntax**: Variables, data types, operators
2. **Functions**: Definition, parameters, return values
3. **Control Flow**: Conditional statements and loops
4. **Data Structures**: Arrays and string manipulation
5. **Problem Solving**: Breaking down problems into smaller parts
6. **Code Organization**: Writing clean, readable code

## üéØ Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- Node.js installed on your system
- Text editor or IDE

## üí° Tips for Learning

1. **Read the code**: Understand each line before running
2. **Modify examples**: Try changing values and see what happens
3. **Add features**: Extend the programs with your own functions
4. **Practice regularly**: Solve similar problems to reinforce learning
5. **Debug errors**: Learn from mistakes and error messages

## üîß Common Issues
